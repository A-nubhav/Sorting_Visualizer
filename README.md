# Sorting_Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer will be displaying the working mechanism of various sorting algorithms like
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort and Count Sort.
The main objective of developing this Visualizer is to make a learner comfortable in learning these techniques quickly and easily. 
Discrete event simulation, Operating Systems, real time systems and many other as well. 
In the general case the efficiency of an application depends on the efficiency of sorting algorithm used.
